###### **Universal gate**

A gate is a universal gate if a collection of that gates can be arranged to implement AND, OR & NOT gates

A universal gate is functionally complete

##### NAND and NOR implementation of circuits

- Function-based approach
    - Use De Morgan’s law to move from AND-OR to NAND-NOR
    - E.g. A+B = (A+ B)’’ = ((A)’(B)’)’
    
- Circuit-based approach
    - Replace all gates with NAND gates
    - Undo any complements caused by the replacement


NAND & NOR gates are generally faster than AND & OR gates in most technologies
