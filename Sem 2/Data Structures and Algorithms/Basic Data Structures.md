## Abstract Data Types

**What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) ?**

- It is a Data structure specification
- It defines the set of operations that can be performed on the structure
- It is implementation independent

**Importance(Advantages) of ADT**

- Data abstraction
- Allows us to focus on important aspects of data
- Encapsulation or information hiding
-  **Modularity**: ADTs promote modularity as they allow data and operations to be packaged together. This makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

**Disadvantages**

- ***Overhead****: Implementing ADTs can add overhead in terms of memory and processing, which can affect performance.
- ***Complexity****: ADTs can be complex to implement, especially for large and complex data structures.


An ADT can primarily do three kinds of operations.Â 

1. _Constructing the data structure / Adding an element_
2. _Accessing an element._
3. _Modify
