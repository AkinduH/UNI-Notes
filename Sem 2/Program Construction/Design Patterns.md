Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. They represent solutions to common design problems in object-oriented software development.

In software engineering, design patterns indeed provide best-practice solutions to recurring design problems.
1. **Flexible**: They should be adaptable for a wide range of similar problems.
2. **Reusable**: As problems evolve requiring changes in the solution, the design pattern should still be applicable.


#### Elements of a design pattern

1. **Name**: A concise and expressive name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern.
    
2. **Abstract Description of Problem**: This outlines the problem that the pattern addresses. It describes the situations where the pattern is applicable. It might include a list of conditions that must be met before it is sensible to apply the pattern.
    
3. **Abstract Description of Solution**: This part depicts the design pattern’s structure in terms of objects and classes, their roles, collaborations, and distribution of responsibilities. It doesn’t describe specific concrete design or implementation, because a pattern is like a template that can be applied in many different situations.
    
4. **Analysis of Consequences**: This section describes the results, side effects, and trade-offs caused by using the pattern. It includes impact on flexibility, extensibility, or portability, changes to the system’s performance, and memory requirements.


Generally, both the problem and the solution are described at a higher level of abstraction, allowing for adaptation and reuse across different contexts. The use of each pattern has consequences that could be either advantageous or disadvantageous in a particular application context.

 Creational patterns deal with the creation of objects, 
 Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects, 
 Behavioral patterns deal with the communication between objects.
