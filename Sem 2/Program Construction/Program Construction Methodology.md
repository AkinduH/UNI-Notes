- **System Level:**
    - Focuses on the big-picture design of the entire system, meeting the customer's broad needs.
    - Includes requirements analysis, specification, architecture design, and validation.
- **Software Level:**
    - Dives into the specific software components and how they will be built.
    - Includes requirements analysis, specification, architecture design, module design, coding, testing, deployment, maintenance, and verification.

**Requirements**

- **Functional Requirements (FRs):**
    - Define _what_ the system or product should do.
    - Describe specific features, capabilities, or behaviors.
    - Typically defined by users or stakeholders.
    - Examples: "Record rainfall data," "Generate reports," "Display data on a map."
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**
    - Define _how well_ the system or product should perform.
    - Describe quality attributes or constraints.
    - Often defined by developers, experts, or standards.
    - Examples: "Reliability," "Performance," "Usability," "Security."

**Defining Requirements**

- **Functionality-Based (FRs):**
    - Focus on the specific actions or tasks the system should perform.
- **Behavior-Based (FRs):**
    - Emphasize the relationship between inputs and outputs.
- **Illities (NFRs):**
    - Common non-functional requirements categorized by their "-ility" ending (e.g., reliability, scalability, usability).
- **Challenges with NFRs:**
    - Subjectivity, ambiguity, and potential conflicts between different NFRs.

**Key Differences**

| Feature       | Functional Requirements       | Non-Functional Requirements         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Objective     | What the product does         | How the product works               |
| Focus         | User requirements             | User expectations                   |
| Origin        | Defined by users              | Defined by developers/experts       |
| Documentation | Use cases                     | Quality attributes                  |
| Examples      | Record data, generate reports | Reliability, performance, usability |
