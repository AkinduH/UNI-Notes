**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
- **Core Goal:** To develop intelligent entities (machines, software, systems) that can reason, learn, and act in ways that are typically associated with human intelligence.

**The Four Definitions/Goals:**
- **Systems that think like humans (Cognitive Science):** AI research that aims to replicate human cognitive processes, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making.
- **Systems that think rationally (Laws of thought/logic):** AI that focuses on developing systems that adhere to logical principles and formal reasoning.
- **Systems that act like humans (Turing Test):** AI that seeks to create systems that can behave in ways that are indistinguishable from humans, passing the Turing Test.
- **Systems that act rationally (Rational Agents):** AI that emphasizes developing systems that make optimal decisions based on their goals and available information, regardless of whether those decisions align with human behavior.


Thinking Humanly:   The Cognitive Modeling Approach
Acting humanly:       The Turing Test Approach
Thinking Rationally:  The “Laws of Thought” Approach
Acting Rationally:      The Rational Agent Approach

A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or when there is uncertainty, the best-expected outcome.
- Rational agents: Act to achieve the best outcome.
- Thinking rationally is one way to act rationally (e.g., not just logic).
- Can react quickly without reasoning (e.g., taking hand off hot stove).
- Different from acting human (humans are not always rational).
- Advantages:
    - More general than "laws of thought" approach.
    - Easier to develop scientifically.
- **AI and Rational Agents:**
    - Focus on building AI that acts according to a set objective.
    - "Right thing" depends on the objective given.
    - This module explores general principles for such agents.
- **Limited Rationality:**
    - Perfect rationality is impractical in complex situations due to high computational demands.
