Operating System is a program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a 
computer and the computer hardware

 Four components of a computer system
	 Hardware                       - CPU, memory, I/O devices
	 Operating system          
	 Application programs    - Word processors, compilers, web browsers
	 Users                              - People, machines, other computers


### Operating System (OS) Definition

Defining an operating system (OS) isn't straightforward, as there's no single, universally accepted definition. A practical approximation is "everything a vendor ships when you order an operating system" though this can vary significantly depending on the vendor and the specific OS.

At its core, the OS includes the **kernel**, which is the one program continuously running on the computer. The kernel manages hardware resources, handles processes, and provides essential services to other programs.

Beyond the kernel, the OS encompasses:

- **System programs:** These are shipped with the OS but are not part of the kernel. They provide additional functionalities and utilities to users and applications.
- **Application programs:** These are programs not associated with the OS and are installed separately by users to perform specific tasks.

Modern operating systems for general-purpose and mobile computing often include **middleware**. This refers to a set of software frameworks that offer extra services to application developers, such as databases, multimedia capabilities, and graphics tools.

### Computer-System Operation

1. **Concurrent Execution:** The CPU (Central Processing Unit) and I/O (Input/Output) devices can execute instructions simultaneously, improving overall system performance. While the CPU performs calculations and processes data, I/O devices handle input and output operations.
    
2. **Device Controllers:** Each device type (e.g., keyboard, disk drive) is managed by a dedicated device controller. These controllers are responsible for communication between the device and the rest of the system.
    
3. **Local Buffers:** Each device controller has a local buffer, a temporary storage area for data being transferred to or from the device. This buffer helps to smooth out the differences in speed between the device and the CPU.
    
4. **Device Drivers:** For each type of device controller, there's a corresponding operating system device driver. These drivers are software modules that manage the interaction between the device controller and the operating system. They provide a standardized interface for the OS to communicate with different devices.
    
5. **Data Transfer:** The CPU is responsible for moving data between the main memory and the local buffers of the device controllers. When data is to be sent to a device, the CPU writes it to the device's local buffer. Similarly, when data is received from a device, the CPU reads it from the device's local buffer.
    
6. **I/O Operation:** The actual input or output operation occurs between the device and its local buffer. The device controller manages this process independently of the CPU.
    
7. **Interrupt:** Once a device controller has completed its operation (e.g., finishing a data transfer), it signals the CPU by causing an interrupt. An interrupt is a signal that temporarily suspends the CPU's current task and allows it to attend to the device's request.

### Common Functions of Interrupts

- **Transfer of Control:** When an interrupt occurs, it immediately transfers control from the currently executing program to the corresponding interrupt service routine (ISR). This transfer is typically done through the interrupt vector, a table containing the addresses of all the ISRs.
    
- **Saving the Interrupted Instruction:** The interrupt architecture automatically saves the address of the interrupted instruction. This allows the system to resume execution from that point once the interrupt has been handled.
    
- **Traps and Exceptions:** Interrupts can be triggered by software as well as hardware. A software-generated interrupt is called a trap or exception. It can be caused by an error in a program (like division by zero) or a deliberate request from the program (like a system call).
    
- **Interrupt-Driven Operating System:** Modern operating systems are designed to be interrupt-driven. This means that the OS relies heavily on interrupts to manage various tasks, such as handling I/O operations, scheduling processes, and responding to user input.

**Here's a summary of the interrupt handling process:**

1. Interrupt occurs.
2. CPU state is saved.
3. Interrupt type is determined.
4. Control is transferred to the appropriate ISR.
5. ISR executes, performing necessary actions.
6. CPU state is restored.
7. Interrupted program resumes execution.

### I/O Handling Methods

| Feature         | Synchronous I/O (Blocking)                           | Asynchronous I/O (Non-blocking)                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Control Flow    | Returns to user program only after I/O completion    | Returns to user program immediately after I/O request         |
| CPU Utilization | Low during I/O (idle via wait or wait loop)          | High, can execute other tasks while I/O in progress           |
| Outstanding I/O | Only one at a time                                   | Multiple requests possible                                    |
| Implementation  | Simpler, uses wait instructions or wait loops        | More complex, uses system calls and interrupts                |
| Use Cases       | Short, infrequent I/O operations                     | Long-running, multiple I/O operations                         |
| Advantages      | Easier to understand, guarantees data transfer order | Efficient use of CPU, better responsiveness                   |
| Disadvantages   | Inefficient for long I/O, no concurrent I/O          | More difficult to implement, potential synchronization issues |
Additional Mechanisms:

- **Synchronous I/O:**
    - **Wait instruction:** Idles the CPU until an interrupt signals I/O completion.
    - **Wait loop:** Continuously checks I/O status, potentially causing memory contention.
- **Asynchronous I/O:**
    - **System call:** Requests OS to start I/O and returns immediately.
    - **Device-status table:** Maintains information on each device's status (busy/idle).
    - **Interrupt:** Signals I/O completion, allowing the OS to update the device table and notify the user program.

### Storage Structure

- **Main Memory (Primary Storage):**
    - Directly accessible by CPU
    - Random access (Can be accessed from any location with equal speed)
    - Volatile (loses data on power loss)
    - Primarily implemented as Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)
- **Secondary Storage (Auxiliary Storage):**
    - Extends main memory
    - Non-volatile (retains data even without power)
    - Larger capacity than main memory
    - Slower access than main memory

**Types of Secondary Storage:**

- **Hard Disk Drives (HDDs):**
    - Magnetic storage on rotating platters
    - Organized into tracks and sectors
    - Managed by a disk controller
    - High capacity, lower cost, slower speed
- **Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Devices (e.g., SSDs):**
    - Use flash memory or similar technologies
    - Significantly faster than HDDs
    - More durable than HDDs
    - Increasingly popular due to speed and affordability

A word is made up of one or more bytes. For example, a computer that has 64-bit registers and 64-bit memory addressing typically has 64-bit (8-byte) words. 

#### Direct Memory Access (DMA)

- Purpose: Enables high-speed I/O devices to transfer data directly to/from main memory without CPU intervention.
- Mechanism:
    - CPU initiates DMA transfer.
    - DMA controller takes control of system bus.
    - Data transferred directly between device and memory.
    - Single interrupt generated upon completion.

### Operating-System Operations

**System Startup:**

1. **Bootstrap Program:** When a computer is powered on, a simple program called the bootstrap program (or bootloader) is executed. This program initializes the system, performs basic hardware checks, and loads the kernel of the operating system into memory.
2. **Kernel Loading:** The kernel, the core of the operating system, is then loaded into memory and begins execution. It sets up essential data structures, initializes devices, and prepares the system for further operation.
3. **System Daemons:** The kernel initiates system daemons (or services), which are background processes that run independently of the kernel and provide various services to the system and users. Examples of system daemons include network services, logging services, and printing services.

**Interrupt-Driven Nature:**

- **Hardware Interrupts:** The operating system is interrupt-driven, meaning that it responds to hardware interrupts generated by devices like keyboards, mouse, network cards, and disk drives. 
- **Software Interrupts:** The OS also handles software interrupts, which can be caused by various events:
    - **Exceptions (Traps)**
    - **System Calls**
    - **Other Process Problems**

### Multiprogramming (Batch System)

- Organizes jobs (code and data) so the CPU always has one to execute.
- A subset of jobs is kept in memory; one job is selected via job scheduling.
- The OS switches to another job when the current one has to wait (e.g., for I/O).

### Multitasking (Timesharing)

- An extension of batch systems where the CPU switches jobs frequently, enabling interactive computing.
- Response time should be less than 1 second.
- Each user has at least one process executing in memory.
- CPU scheduling occurs when multiple jobs are ready to run.
- Swapping moves processes in and out of memory if they don't fit.
- Virtual memory allows processes to execute even if they are not completely in memory.

### Dual-mode Operation

- **Purpose**: Allows the OS to protect itself and other system components.
- **Modes**:
    - **User mode**: Mode bit set to "user" when user code is running.
    - **Kernel mode**: Mode bit set to "kernel" when kernel code is executing.
- **Mode Bit**: Provided by hardware to distinguish between user and kernel code.
- **Security**:
    - User cannot explicitly set the mode bit to "kernel."
    - A system call changes the mode to kernel, and returning from the call resets it to user.
- **Privileged Instructions**: Certain instructions can only be executed in kernel mode.

### Timer

- Timer to prevent infinite loop (or process hogging resources)
- Timer is set to interrupt the computer after some time period

### Process Management Activities

The operating system is responsible for the following activities in 
connection with process management:
▪ Creating and deleting both user and system processes
▪ Suspending and resuming processes
▪ Providing mechanisms for process synchronization
▪ Providing mechanisms for process communication
▪ Providing mechanisms for deadlock handling

- **Process management** includes the following activities: creating and deleting both user and system processes; suspending and resuming processes; and providing mechanisms for process synchronization, communication, and deadlock handling.
- **Memory management** involves determining what is in memory and when, and is done to optimize CPU utilization and response time for users.
- **File-system management** involves abstracting physical properties to a logical storage unit called a file.
- **Mass-storage management** is important because it manages data that does not fit into the main memory or must be kept for long periods.
- **Caching** is a technique that is performed at many levels in the computer system, and involves copying information in use from slower storage to faster storage temporarily.
- The **I/O subsystem** is responsible for managing I/O, memory management, and drivers for specific hardware devices.
- **Protection** is any mechanism for controlling access of processes or users to resources defined by the OS, while **security** is the defense of the system against internal and external attacks.
- **Virtualization** allows operating systems to run applications within other OSes. Emulation is used when the source CPU type is different from the target CPU type.
- **Distributed systems** are a collection of separate, possibly heterogeneous, systems that are networked together. A **network operating system** provides features between systems across the network.
- **Computer system architecture** is the design of the computer system, and most systems use a single, general-purpose processor. **Multiprocessor systems** are growing in use and importance, and are also known as parallel systems or tightly-coupled systems. There are two types of multiprocessor systems: asymmetric multiprocessing and symmetric multiprocessing.
- **Clustered systems** are a type of multiprocessor system that consists of multiple systems working together.
- **Computing environments** can be traditional, mobile, client-server, peer-to-peer, cloud computing, or real-time embedded. **Traditional** computing environments are stand-alone, general-purpose machines, while **mobile** environments are handheld devices like smartphones and tablets. **Client-server** environments are characterized by clients that request services from servers. **Peer-to-peer** (P2P) computing environments do not distinguish between clients and servers; all nodes can act as clients and/or servers. **Cloud computing** delivers computing, storage, and apps as a service across a network. **Real-time embedded systems** are the most prevalent form of computers and have well-defined fixed time constraints.
- **Free and open-source operating systems** are made available in source-code format rather than binary closed-source format.
- **Kernel data structures** are used by the operating system to manage the system's resources. Some common kernel data structures include singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, binary search trees, hash maps, and bitmaps.
