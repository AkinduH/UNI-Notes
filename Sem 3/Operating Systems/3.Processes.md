7. Which of the following pieces of information is typically NOT found in the PCB?
    
    - Process state
    - Program counter
    - **File contents**
    - I/O status information

**Process Scheduling**

8. What is the role of the process scheduler?
    
    - To execute processes
    - **To determine which process gets to run next on the CPU**
    - To manage the memory used by processes
    - To handle communication between processes
9. Which queue contains processes that are resident in main memory and ready to execute?
    
    - **Ready queue**
    - Wait queue
    - Job queue
    - Device queue
10. What is a context switch?
    
    - Changing the state of a process
    - **Switching the CPU from one process to another**
    - Moving a process from memory to disk
    - Loading a program into memory

**Process Operations**

11. How does a parent process typically create a child process in a Unix-like system?
    
    - By using the `create()` system call
    - **By using the `fork()` system call**
    - By copying its own PCB
    - By directly modifying the process table
12. What does the `exec()` system call do in a Unix-like system?
    
    - It creates a new process.
    - **It replaces the process's memory space with a new program.**
    - It terminates a process.
    - It waits for a child process to terminate.
13. Which system call is used by a parent process to wait for the termination of a child process?
    

- `block()`
- `join()`
- **`wait()`**
- `terminate()`

14. A process whose parent has terminated without invoking the `wait()` system call is called a(n):
    - **Orphan**
    - Zombie
    - Detached process
    - Ghost process

**Multiprocess Architecture**

15. What is a key advantage of the multiprocess architecture in web browsers like Google Chrome?

- Faster page loading
- Reduced memory usage
- **Improved stability and security by isolating websites in separate processes**
- Simplified development

**General Concepts**

16. Why might processes need to communicate with each other?
    
    - To share information
    - To speed up computation
    - To support modularity in program design
    - **All of the above**
17. What is a zombie process?
    
    - **A process that has terminated but its parent hasn't yet called `wait()` to retrieve its status**
    - A process that is consuming excessive CPU resources
    - A process that is waiting for an event to occur
    - A process that has been infected with a virus

**Interprocess Communication (IPC)**

1. What are the two primary models of interprocess communication (IPC)?
    
    - Direct and indirect communication
    - **Shared memory and message passing**
    - Synchronous and asynchronous communication
    - Blocking and non-blocking communication
2. What is a race condition in the context of shared memory IPC?
    
    - When multiple processes try to access the same shared memory location simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results
    - When a process tries to read from an empty shared memory buffer
    - When a process tries to write to a full shared memory buffer
    - When a process fails to release a shared memory lock
3. In message passing IPC, what is the difference between a blocking send and a non-blocking send?
    
    - A blocking send waits for the receiver to acknowledge receipt of the message, while a non-blocking send does not.
    - A blocking send allows the sender to continue execution immediately, while a non-blocking send makes the sender wait for the message to be delivered.
    - **A blocking send makes the sender wait until the message is received, while a non-blocking send allows the sender to continue execution immediately.**
    - A blocking send is used for small messages, while a non-blocking send is used for large messages.
4. What is the purpose of a mailbox in indirect message passing IPC?
    
    - To store the physical address of the receiving process
    - To buffer messages until the receiver is ready
    - To establish a direct communication link between two processes
    - **To provide a central location where multiple processes can send and receive messages**
5. What is a benefit of using message passing IPC over shared memory IPC?
    
    - **Message passing IPC typically handles synchronization between processes more easily.**
    - Message passing IPC is generally faster than shared memory IPC.
    - Message passing IPC requires less memory overhead than shared memory IPC.
    - Message passing IPC is more suitable for communication between processes on the same system.

**Pipes**

6. What is a key difference between ordinary pipes and named pipes?
    
    - Ordinary pipes can be accessed from outside the creating process, while named pipes cannot.
    - **Ordinary pipes require a parent-child relationship between communicating processes, while named pipes do not.**
    - Ordinary pipes are bidirectional, while named pipes are unidirectional.
    - Ordinary pipes are slower than named pipes.
7. What is a typical use case for an ordinary pipe?
    
    - Communication between a client and a server on different systems
    - **Communication between a parent process and a child process**
    - Broadcasting data to multiple processes simultaneously
    - Sharing large amounts of data between processes

**Client-Server Communication**

8. What is a socket in the context of client-server communication?
    
    - A physical network connection between two systems
    - A shared memory segment used for communication
    - A message queue for exchanging data
    - **An endpoint for communication, identified by an IP address and a port number**
9. In a Remote Procedure Call (RPC), what is the role of a stub?
    
    - To handle the conversion of data between different architectures
    - **To act as a proxy for the remote procedure, hiding the details of network communication from the client and server**
    - To manage the communication ports used for RPC
    - To authenticate the client and server
10. Why might a remote procedure call (RPC) be more complex to implement than a local procedure call?
    

- **RPCs need to handle potential network failures and ensure reliable message delivery.**
- RPCs typically involve more data marshalling and unmarshalling.
- RPCs require the client and server to be running the same operating system.
- RPCs are generally slower than local procedure calls.
