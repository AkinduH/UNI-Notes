**One-shot learning** is a classification task where the model learns to recognize new classes from just **one** example per class.
This is commonly used in **face recognition** (e.g., recognizing a person from just one image).

**One-pass learning** (also called **online learning** or **single-pass learning**) refers to algorithms that process each data point **only once** and do not revisit past data.
This is useful for **streaming data** or **large datasets** where storing the entire dataset is impractical.
Examples include **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** and certain **incremental learning algorithms**.

Iterations is the number of batches or steps through partitioned packets of the training data. 

Epoch refers to one cycle through the full training dataset.
